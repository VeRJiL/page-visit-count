## In this project we can count page visit using redis
- we are using docker in order to use redis
- in order to use the base project we need to dockerize the base
project and make a network between base project docker and redis
docker so we use docker-compose in order to setup the network
between these two dockers

**I Order To Run the Project Just Run this Command `docker-compose up`**
